The novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) has become the most pressing issue facing mankind. Like a wildfire burning through the world, the COVID-19 disease has changed the global landscape in only three months.In this article, we'll explore the feasibility and difficulties in building a system capable of detecting various causes of pneumonia in Chest X-rays, using a relatively facile Transfer Learning process and a constrained dataset.
